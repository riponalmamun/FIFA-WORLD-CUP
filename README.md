                  Project Title: FIFA World Cup

                       Project Description:
For the FIFA World Cup 2006, a fly-over has been constructed between the hotel 
where the teams are staying and the stadium. This fly-over will be used by the 
German team and the Italian team in the upcoming semifinal on Tuesday. A tram 
car is used to cross this fly-over, but it seats only four people, and must always 
carry a full load. We cannot put three Italians and one German in the same tramcar, 
because the Italians would be in majority and might try to intimidate the German. 
Similarly, we cannot put three Germans in the same tram-car with one Italian. All 
other combinations are safe. Implement a synchronization method to solve the 
problem. You must output the progress of the processes. E.g., When a player 
arrives you should output who arrived and also print the total number of Germans 
and Italians waiting to board the tram. When a tram leaves you should output that 
as well.
